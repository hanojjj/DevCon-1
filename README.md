#### Design Rationale

The experience envisioned was to take your normal platformer and add a bit of a spin to it. The player is expected to have to adjust their normal movement and take a slower approach. 
It's experimental because most people who play platformers tend to move very fast. Also, being a large part of the speedrunning community. This changes how people will have to approach the level.
